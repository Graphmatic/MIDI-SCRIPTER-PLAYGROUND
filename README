many noticed the weird behaviour of the PluginParameters array and the ParameterChanged/SetParameter function that turn into endless loop.

After some tweaking, I discovered that ParameterChanged() have and undocumented property named "caller", that get a value of "null" if 
ParameterChanged() is called from a change on the UI or from SetParameter(), and get as value the function from where it's triggered 
if it's triggered from any function elsewhere in the code (excepted of course SetParameter() ).

So I've done a little POC that show how to use this hidden property, to be able to use UI controls without looping, as well as linking
this UI controls to external CC, and not getting in trouble when an external CC update a value of PluginParameters array and so refresh the UI... without looping.

The POC contains many Trace() so you can check all this stuff.

Just copy/paste the content of .js file into your MIDI Scripter.

If you have to deal with other undocumented functions or objects, as the documentation is really crappy, this JS snippet may help you:

var objs = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(TheObjectYouWantToTest);
for(var i in objs ){
  Trace(objs[i]);
}
or to know if a given property is a function:

var functionNames = [];

Object.getOwnPropertyNames(TheObjectYouWantToTest).forEach(function(property) {
  if(typeof obj[property] === 'function') {
    functionNames.push(property);
  }
});
for(var i in functionNames )
{ 
   Trace(functionNames[i]);
}
